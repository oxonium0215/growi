 * Contract between the vault E2E integration tests and the globalSetup that

 *
 * The tests in this directory MUST NOT bake in implementation-specific values
 * (specific file names, page IDs, free-form fixture data). They reference the
 * constants below; the globalSetup is responsible for materialising them.
 *
 * Page paths are deliberately lower-case-only so the path mapper does not
 * append a pageId-derived suffix, making the mapped file name predictable
 * across runs without inspecting the seeded ObjectIds.
 *
 * If you add a new contract, set it both here AND in the globalSetup; the
 * skip-marker check at the bottom of this file enforces that all required
 * setup env vars are present before the integration tests run.
